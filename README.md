# Vehical-Tracking-and-Monitoring-System
The Vehicle Tracking system is an important system which is widely used by fleet management and vehicle owners throughout the world.This project aims to build such a tracking system which provides security not only to the vehicle but its owner as well. Along with tracking it also monitors the vehicle's movement and notifies the user when the vehicle needs servicing. It is designed to track the position of a vehicle at any period of time and it also consists of an accident alert system which can be used to rescue people at the time of an accident. This system constantly watches a moving vehicle and reports the status on demand. When theft is identified, the owner sends an SMS to the device to know about its whereabouts. Other than tracking, the system monitors distance travelled by vehicle and fuel levels. Using these parameters the owner will be notified when the vehicle needs servicing. These parameters are further used to calculate mileage which helps reduce travelling expenses.
